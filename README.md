100 DAYS USER GUIDE
----------------------------------------------------------
1. GAME IDEA AND PREMISE

In this game, you are a car dealership owner and your goal is to sell cars and earn as much money as you can. You can buy cheap, used cars from people or other car dealerships, or you can buy brand new cars directly from the manufacturer which cost more. You then put these cars up for sale and wait until it is sold. You get 100 days to conduct your business and sell as many cars as possible, thus the name. Your money only matters as a currency and a means to an end, which is achieving a high life-time profit, or total money earned over the 100 days.

2. GETTING STARTED

Once you start the game, you are given the choice to load a save file. If you are starting a new game, you should choose N for new game since you don't have any save files. If you choose S, you may load a save file of a game that was played earlier.

Next, you will enter the main menu. You will be given 7 choices that are basically: buy used cars, buy new cars, view inventory/place cars for sale, view cars on sale/remove cars from sale, ask for market advice, end the day, and save and end the game. Choose any of these options to go into each submenu.

3. BUYING CARS

Entering 1 or 2 in the main menu takes you to a menu with a list of cars. In both cases, all the cars are randomly generated and come with different attributes such as make, model, size, etc. The only difference between choosing 1 and 2 in the main menu is that choice 1 takes you to the used cars list while choice 2 takes you to the new cars list.

Used cars are overall cheaper because they have nonzero mileage which degrades their value. New cars have 0 mileage which causes them to be full price.

You can buy any car from the list of 10 cars by choosing its ID. Once you buy a car, your money is subtracted by the price of the car and it will be placed in your inventory. You may buy up to 3 cars per day.

4. INVENTORY

Choosing 4 in the main menu brings you to the inventory screen. Similar to the used and new cars screens, it gives you a list of 10 cars with an ID to choose. Choosing a car's ID prompts you to put the car up for sale. You may sell the car for whatever price you want, but to make a profit, you have to sell for a price higher than what you bought it for.

Once you put a car up for sale, the car isn't immediately sold, it is instead put into the sale cars screen which you can get to by choosing 4 in the main menu. You may put up to 3 cars for sale per day.

5. SALE CARS

Choosing 5 in the main menu brings you to the sale cars screen. This is where your cars are being held as they are waiting to be sold. You may notice that you can see the price you are selling it for as well as a letter grade rating next to the price.

The rating describes how optimized your car's price is in terms of chance to sell and profit you make from selling it. Selling a car for too much can reduce the sell chance to zero and selling the car for too little will give you no profit. In both cases, you will get a letter grade of F. In order to get a high letter grade, you should strive to sell the car for roughly 50% profit. This will give you the best odds for selling for the highest profit; maximum efficiency.

If you sell a car for 50% of the price you bought it for, you may not get the maximum rating because technically you want to sell the car for 150% of the expected, or market, price, which is a hidden metric within the game that changes with certain conditions. The price you bought the car for is somewhere within the ballpark of the expected but it's almost never exact. That's why selling the car for 150% of the bought price won't always give you the best rating.

If you ever find out a car you sold has a very low rating such as D or even F, you may consider removing the car from sale and reselling it for another price. The demands of the market may change every day and that impacts the expected price of the car, thus changing the optimal selling price, too. Experimenting with the selling price is part of the fun of the game and keeping up with market trends to make your car as optimally price as possible is the true challenge of the game.

6. MARKET ANALYST

Choosing 5 in the main menu brings you to the market analyst screen. Here, you can pay a market analyst 5000 to get a hint at what the current market trends are.

The market can change every day which impacts the most and least demanded make, car size, and car type. A car with an attribute in high demand raises its expected price, and vice versa with an attribute in low demand. This market demand causes a car's value, or its expected price, to fluctuate day-by-day. This is why staying ahead of the herd and knowing what the current market trends are can generate higher profit in the long run.

Choosing to pay the analyst fee will give you a hint in one car attribute and tell you which is in high demand and which is in low demand. Knowing this information means you can buy many cars with high demand attributes and sell them for more than you normally would.

7. ENDING THE DAY

Choosing 6 in the main menu ends the day and starts a new one. At the end of a day, the game deducts maintenance and operational expenses from your money. The base cost is 500, but each additional car carries an additional amount to maintain. More expensive cars have more expensive maintenance costs.

If you ever drop to 0 or below in money, you lose the game automatically. In order to avoid this, you should try to have a surplus of money that is enough to pay the maintenance and operational costs without causing you to go bankrupt. This is especially important because often you can go days without selling any cars and you will still be paying maintenance costs every day. Having a considerable surplus that can last for multiple days without going below 0 is paramount.

8. SAVING THE GAME

Choosing 7 in the main menu saves your current game into a save file called "SaveFile.json" in the same directory as the game file. After that, the game ends.

If you choose to load the game again, you may load the save file at the start and get all your progress back straight from where you left off.

9. REACHING THE END

Once you reach the end of your 100 day, you have completed the game. Your life time profit is then shown to you and the game ends.

Currently, the game does not have a way to store high scores so you may want to record these somewhere. In the future, I may go back and add a way to record all scores by name and date so you can see how well you do compared to your previous attempts.

10. CLOSING TIPS

In this game, you may choose to play it any way you like to achieve the highest score possible. You can buy only cheap, used cars and always have your sale cars list full to get the maximum chance to sell cars and have a continuous cash flow. In contrast, you can buy only expensive, new cars that sell for a much higher profit, but you can only sell a couple at a time and are sold infrequently. Or you can do any kind of strategy in between. There are many strategies that can be used to get a high score. Even I don't know which the best one is and I built this game. What I can do is give you some tips to help you do the best you can in this game using the knowledge I have of the inner workings of the game.

• Try to always keep your money above 20000 so that you have a safety net in case you go many days without selling any cars.

• Check the sale cars screen every day to see their ratings. As the market changes every day, so do the expected prices of your cars. Often, your car's rating can drop and should be resold at an adjusted price to improve the rating. Sometimes a car being sold with a low rating can improve its rating a day later, too. You just have to always be on top of your cars being sold so that they don't become unprofitable or unsellable.

• Try to maximize your limit of buying and selling 3 cars per day. Buying new cars and selling them is the only way to make profit in this game, so not using all your buying and selling attempts is inefficient and likely won't net you a high score. Of course you must be sensible; never just buys cars just because you have enough money because that puts you at risk of going bankrupt. Using your sell attempts to resell a car you own to improve its rating is also a good idea when you have no other cars to put up for sale. You just have to be smart with it.

• Using the market analyst's advice is better for the long run since you pay a small price to greatly improve the profits of cars that are in high demand. Just make sure you don't pay for the market analyst's advice when you are low on cash since it's better to keep that as a safety net.

I hope you enjoy my game. If you like it, please give me feedback and share it with your friends.
